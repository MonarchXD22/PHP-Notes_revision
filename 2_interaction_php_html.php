<!-- when both language communicate for example in form and making requests from client to server or vice versa (http requests) then it is called interaction of php and html
so in simple terms requesting data from php and showing it on browser is all the interaction of php &html -->
<!-- How does this request work and what are these -->
<!-- get and post are main requests(other-> delete,put,patch) -->

<!-- get- in get request the data/request is visible in address bar, less secure, used to fetch data from server. -->
<!-- post- is not visible in address bar, secure, used to create and update operations on server.(basically sending data too ex. from a form in form of body) -->
